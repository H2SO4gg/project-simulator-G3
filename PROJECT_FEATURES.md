## feature/T-21:Travel Agency Update Automation Gateway
This board develops the automated system that ensures integrated travel agencies receive verified, real-time flight updates for their clients' bookings. The system will monitor booking status changes, schedule modifications, and check-in events, then format and transmit these updates to agency systems via secure APIs or webhooks. Updates will be batched or real-time based on agency preference and include full itinerary details, passenger status, and any actionable items (e.g., Check-in now open). A verification layer will confirm the accuracy of information before transmission. Agencies will have a dedicated portal to view update logs, configure notification preferences, and manually refresh booking data. The system will handle retries for failed deliveries and provide delivery status reports. Integration with agency back-office systems ensures updates are reflected in their internal tools and customer communications. This automation reduces manual phone calls and emails, improving accuracy and efficiency for both airlines and agencies. The system must be highly reliable, as agencies depend on this data for customer service.

## feature/T-24: Administrative Reporting & Analytics Suite
This board develops the comprehensive reporting and analytics suite for administrators and analysts. The system will allow generation of ad-hoc and scheduled reports on system usage, user activity, booking trends, revenue analysis, and operational metrics. Users can select data dimensions (time, route, user segment), apply filters, and choose visualization types (tables, charts, graphs). Reports can be exported in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) and scheduled for email delivery to stakeholders. Pre-built report templates will cover common needs: daily bookings, monthly revenue, user growth, system error logs. The suite includes a query builder for advanced users to create custom reports without SQL knowledge. Integration with data warehouses will ensure reporting does not impact transactional systems. Dashboards within the suite will show real-time system health and key admin metrics. Role-based permissions control access to sensitive reports. The goal is to provide administrators with deep insights into platform performance, user behavior, and business trends, supporting data-driven operational decisions.
** Status: Implemented**

## feature/T-26: Revenue & Occupancy Analytics (Admin)
This board develops the analytics module focused on financial performance and cabin utilization. The system will provide detailed reports on revenue by route, fare class, sales channel, and time period. Occupancy analytics will show load factors, seat map utilization, and upgrade uptake. Integration with financial systems will allow comparison of revenue against costs, calculating profitability metrics. Predictive models may forecast future demand and recommend pricing adjustments. The interface will include interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities to understand booking patterns, ancillary revenue contribution, and seasonality effects. Reports can be segmented by partner agency performance, showing commission payouts and sales volumes. The system will help revenue management teams optimize pricing, allocate capacity, and evaluate promotional campaigns. Data visualization will make complex financial data accessible, with key metrics highlighted for quick review. Secure access ensures only authorized finance and revenue management personnel can view sensitive financial data.
