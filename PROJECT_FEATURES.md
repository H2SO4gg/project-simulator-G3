## T-14:System Management & Support 
The System Management & Support feature ensures the platform operates reliably and efficiently at all times. Technical teams can monitor system health, performance metrics, and error logs to quickly detect and resolve issues. Administrators manage user roles, permissions, and global system settings. Automated backups and audit logs protect data and support recovery in case of failures. A dedicated internal support ticket system allows staff and partners to report technical issues and track resolutions. This feature helps maintain system stability, security, and long-term operational continuity.
**Status: Implemented**
## T-5:Partner & Agency Integration Gateway
This feature enables smooth interoperability while maintaining performance, scalability, and trust between all integrated platforms.
## T-3: System Management & Support
The System Management & Support feature ensures the platform operates reliably and efficiently at all times.
**Status: To be added**

## feature/T-21:Travel Agency Update Automation Gateway
This board develops the automated system that ensures integrated travel agencies receive verified, real-time flight updates for their clients' bookings. The system will monitor booking status changes, schedule modifications, and check-in events, then format and transmit these updates to agency systems via secure APIs or webhooks. Updates will be batched or real-time based on agency preference and include full itinerary details, passenger status, and any actionable items (e.g., Check-in now open). A verification layer will confirm the accuracy of information before transmission. Agencies will have a dedicated portal to view update logs, configure notification preferences, and manually refresh booking data. The system will handle retries for failed deliveries and provide delivery status reports. Integration with agency back-office systems ensures updates are reflected in their internal tools and customer communications. This automation reduces manual phone calls and emails, improving accuracy and efficiency for both airlines and agencies. The system must be highly reliable, as agencies depend on this data for customer service.

## feature/T-27: System Health Monitoring & Performance Logs 
This board builds the system health monitoring and logging infrastructure for technical support and developers. The dashboard will display real-time metrics on server health, application performance, database latency, API response times, and error rates. Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) will provide deep visibility into system behavior. Log aggregation will collect application logs, server logs, and security events into a searchable repository with filtering and alerting capabilities. Error tracking will identify and prioritize software bugs, automatically creating tickets in development systems. Performance dashboards will highlight trends and capacity planning indicators. The system will generate automated alerts via email, Slack, or PagerDuty when thresholds are breached. Audit logs will track configuration changes and administrative actions for compliance. The interface must be intuitive for both technical and non-technical support staff, with clear visualizations of system status. This monitoring foundation is critical for maintaining high availability, rapid incident response, and continuous performance optimization.
