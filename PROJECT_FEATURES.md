Technical teams can monitor system health, performance metrics, and error logs to quickly detect and resolve issues. Administrators manage user roles, permissions, and global system settings. Automated backups and audit logs protect data and support recovery in case of failures. A dedicated internal support ticket system allows staff and partners to report technical issues and track resolutions. This feature helps maintain system stability, security, and long-term operational continuity.

## T-6: Booking Engine & Ticketing System
This board oversees the end-to-end booking and ticketing system, transforming flight selections into confirmed reservations. The workflow will guide users through passenger detail collection (with validation for names, dates of birth, and passport information), fare breakdown presentation (base fare, taxes, fees, ancillaries), and secure payment processing. Integration with multiple payment gateways (credit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers) is essential, requiring PCI-DSS compliance and fraud detection mechanisms. Upon successful payment, the system will generate electronic tickets (e-tickets) with unique PNRs (Passenger Name Records), send confirmation emails/SMS, and update inventory. Features include seat selection integration, ancillary service addition (bags, meals), and handling of special requests (wheelchair, infant). The system must support group bookings, infant/child fares, and interline partnerships. A robust booking modification engine will allow changes and cancellations with automated refund calculations. The interface must be intuitive, with clear progress indicators and error handling, ensuring a high conversion rate and user trust.
