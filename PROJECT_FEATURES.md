## T-14:System Management & Support 
The System Management & Support feature ensures the platform operates reliably and efficiently at all times. Technical teams can monitor system health, performance metrics, and error logs to quickly detect and resolve issues. Administrators manage user roles, permissions, and global system settings. Automated backups and audit logs protect data and support recovery in case of failures. A dedicated internal support ticket system allows staff and partners to report technical issues and track resolutions. This feature helps maintain system stability, security, and long-term operational continuity.

## feature/T-21:Travel Agency Update Automation Gateway
This board develops the automated system that ensures integrated travel agencies receive verified, real-time flight updates for their clients' bookings. The system will monitor booking status changes, schedule modifications, and check-in events, then format and transmit these updates to agency systems via secure APIs or webhooks. Updates will be batched or real-time based on agency preference and include full itinerary details, passenger status, and any actionable items (e.g., Check-in now open). A verification layer will confirm the accuracy of information before transmission. Agencies will have a dedicated portal to view update logs, configure notification preferences, and manually refresh booking data. The system will handle retries for failed deliveries and provide delivery status reports. Integration with agency back-office systems ensures updates are reflected in their internal tools and customer communications. This automation reduces manual phone calls and emails, improving accuracy and efficiency for both airlines and agencies. The system must be highly reliable, as agencies depend on this data for customer service.

## feature/T-24: Administrative Reporting & Analytics Suite
This board develops the comprehensive reporting and analytics suite for administrators and analysts. The system will allow generation of ad-hoc and scheduled reports on system usage, user activity, booking trends, revenue analysis, and operational metrics. Users can select data dimensions (time, route, user segment), apply filters, and choose visualization types (tables, charts, graphs). Reports can be exported in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) and scheduled for email delivery to stakeholders. Pre-built report templates will cover common needs: daily bookings, monthly revenue, user growth, system error logs. The suite includes a query builder for advanced users to create custom reports without SQL knowledge. Integration with data warehouses will ensure reporting does not impact transactional systems. Dashboards within the suite will show real-time system health and key admin metrics. Role-based permissions control access to sensitive reports. The goal is to provide administrators with deep insights into platform performance, user behavior, and business trends, supporting data-driven operational decisions.
