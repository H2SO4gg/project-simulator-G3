## T-6: Booking Engine & Ticketing System
This board oversees the end-to-end booking and ticketing system, transforming flight selections into confirmed reservations. The workflow will guide users through passenger detail collection (with validation for names, dates of birth, and passport information), fare breakdown presentation (base fare, taxes, fees, ancillaries), and secure payment processing. Integration with multiple payment gateways (credit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers) is essential, requiring PCI-DSS compliance and fraud detection mechanisms. Upon successful payment, the system will generate electronic tickets (e-tickets) with unique PNRs (Passenger Name Records), send confirmation emails/SMS, and update inventory. Features include seat selection integration, ancillary service addition (bags, meals), and handling of special requests (wheelchair, infant). The system must support group bookings, infant/child fares, and interline partnerships. A robust booking modification engine will allow changes and cancellations with automated refund calculations. The interface must be intuitive, with clear progress indicators and error handling, ensuring a high conversion rate and user trust.
**Status: Implemented**

## feature/T-21:Travel Agency Update Automation Gateway
This board develops the automated system that ensures integrated travel agencies receive verified, real-time flight updates for their clients' bookings. The system will monitor booking status changes, schedule modifications, and check-in events, then format and transmit these updates to agency systems via secure APIs or webhooks. Updates will be batched or real-time based on agency preference and include full itinerary details, passenger status, and any actionable items (e.g., Check-in now open). A verification layer will confirm the accuracy of information before transmission. Agencies will have a dedicated portal to view update logs, configure notification preferences, and manually refresh booking data. The system will handle retries for failed deliveries and provide delivery status reports. Integration with agency back-office systems ensures updates are reflected in their internal tools and customer communications. This automation reduces manual phone calls and emails, improving accuracy and efficiency for both airlines and agencies. The system must be highly reliable, as agencies depend on this data for customer service.

## feature/T-23: Role-Based Dashboard Framework
This board builds the foundational framework that delivers tailored dashboard experiences to every user role within the platform. The framework will detect a user's role (passenger, staff, partner, manager, admin, security) and render a dashboard composed of configurable widgets relevant to their tasks. For passengers: upcoming trips, check-in status, loyalty points. For staff: flight assignments, passenger manifests, operational alerts. For partners: client bookings, commission statements. The framework will allow drag-and-drop customization, letting users arrange, add, or remove widgets. Each widget will be a modular component pulling data from specific APIs. Administrators can define default layouts per role and manage available widgets. The system ensures data segregation; users only see information they are authorized to access. The framework must be performant, loading dashboards quickly with lazy loading for heavy data widgets. Responsive design ensures usability on all devices. This personalized approach enhances productivity and user satisfaction by presenting the most relevant information upfront.
## feature/T-24: Administrative Reporting & Analytics Suite
This board develops the comprehensive reporting and analytics suite for administrators and analysts. The system will allow generation of ad-hoc and scheduled reports on system usage, user activity, booking trends, revenue analysis, and operational metrics. Users can select data dimensions (time, route, user segment), apply filters, and choose visualization types (tables, charts, graphs). Reports can be exported in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) and scheduled for email delivery to stakeholders. Pre-built report templates will cover common needs: daily bookings, monthly revenue, user growth, system error logs. The suite includes a query builder for advanced users to create custom reports without SQL knowledge. Integration with data warehouses will ensure reporting does not impact transactional systems. Dashboards within the suite will show real-time system health and key admin metrics. Role-based permissions control access to sensitive reports. The goal is to provide administrators with deep insights into platform performance, user behavior, and business trends, supporting data-driven operational decisions.

## T-25: Security & Immigration Verification Dashboard
This board creates the secure, specialized dashboard for security and immigration officers to verify passenger travel documents and identity information. The interface will allow officers to search for passengers by flight, name, or document number and view a consolidated profile containing passport details, visa information, booking history, and check-in status. Integration with government systems (e.g., Advance Passenger Information systems) will provide real-time watchlist checks and visa validation. Officers can scan physical documents via connected scanners or manually input data for verification. The system will highlight discrepancies, expired documents, or missing information. All access and verification actions are logged with officer identification for full audit trails. The dashboard must comply with international security standards (e.g., ICAO guidelines) and data protection regulations. It will be accessible only from secure networks, with multi-factor authentication for officer login. The interface is designed for speed and clarity, enabling quick decisions during pre-flight security checks or border control processes.
The Administrative, Security & Analytics Dashboard provides advanced tools for airline management, administrators, and security officers. Management can monitor key performance indicators such as on-time performance, passenger satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Security and immigration officers can securely verify passenger travel documents and identity information. Administrators access analytics related to revenue, seat occupancy, and system usage. Strong role-based permissions ensure that sensitive data is protected and accessed only by authorized personnel. This feature supports compliance, operational transparency, and strategic decision-making across the organization.
## T-4: AI-Powered Assistance & Notification System 
The AI-Powered Assistance & Notification System enhances customer experience by providing intelligent, automated support throughout the travel journey. A 24/7 AI chatbot assists passengers with common queries related to flights, baggage policies, airport services, and travel rules. The system proactively identifies potential issues such as missed connections or delays and sends AI-driven alerts to affected passengers. Personalized travel tips, airport navigation guidance, and relevant updates are also provided based on passenger profiles and itineraries. Additionally, verified automated updates are shared with integrated travel agencies, ensuring consistent and accurate communication across platforms.
