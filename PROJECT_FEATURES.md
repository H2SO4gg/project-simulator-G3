## T-14:System Management & Support 
The System Management & Support feature ensures the platform operates reliably and efficiently at all times. Technical teams can monitor system health, performance metrics, and error logs to quickly detect and resolve issues. Administrators manage user roles, permissions, and global system settings. Automated backups and audit logs protect data and support recovery in case of failures. A dedicated internal support ticket system allows staff and partners to report technical issues and track resolutions. This feature helps maintain system stability, security, and long-term operational continuity.
