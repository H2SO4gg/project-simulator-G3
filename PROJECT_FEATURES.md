## T-25: Security & Immigration Verification Dashboard
This board creates the secure, specialized dashboard for security and immigration officers to verify passenger travel documents and identity information. The interface will allow officers to search for passengers by flight, name, or document number and view a consolidated profile containing passport details, visa information, booking history, and check-in status. Integration with government systems (e.g., Advance Passenger Information systems) will provide real-time watchlist checks and visa validation. Officers can scan physical documents via connected scanners or manually input data for verification. The system will highlight discrepancies, expired documents, or missing information. All access and verification actions are logged with officer identification for full audit trails. The dashboard must comply with international security standards (e.g., ICAO guidelines) and data protection regulations. It will be accessible only from secure networks, with multi-factor authentication for officer login. The interface is designed for speed and clarity, enabling quick decisions during pre-flight security checks or border control processes.
**Status: Implemented**
