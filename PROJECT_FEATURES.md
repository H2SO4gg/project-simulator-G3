## T-14:System Management & Support 
The System Management & Support feature ensures the platform operates reliably and efficiently at all times. Technical teams can monitor system health, performance metrics, and error logs to quickly detect and resolve issues. Administrators manage user roles, permissions, and global system settings. Automated backups and audit logs protect data and support recovery in case of failures. A dedicated internal support ticket system allows staff and partners to report technical issues and track resolutions. This feature helps maintain system stability, security, and long-term operational continuity.

## feature/T-21:Travel Agency Update Automation Gateway
This board develops the automated system that ensures integrated travel agencies receive verified, real-time flight updates for their clients' bookings. The system will monitor booking status changes, schedule modifications, and check-in events, then format and transmit these updates to agency systems via secure APIs or webhooks. Updates will be batched or real-time based on agency preference and include full itinerary details, passenger status, and any actionable items (e.g., Check-in now open). A verification layer will confirm the accuracy of information before transmission. Agencies will have a dedicated portal to view update logs, configure notification preferences, and manually refresh booking data. The system will handle retries for failed deliveries and provide delivery status reports. Integration with agency back-office systems ensures updates are reflected in their internal tools and customer communications. This automation reduces manual phone calls and emails, improving accuracy and efficiency for both airlines and agencies. The system must be highly reliable, as agencies depend on this data for customer service.

## feature/T-23: Role-Based Dashboard Framework
This board builds the foundational framework that delivers tailored dashboard experiences to every user role within the platform. The framework will detect a user's role (passenger, staff, partner, manager, admin, security) and render a dashboard composed of configurable widgets relevant to their tasks. For passengers: upcoming trips, check-in status, loyalty points. For staff: flight assignments, passenger manifests, operational alerts. For partners: client bookings, commission statements. The framework will allow drag-and-drop customization, letting users arrange, add, or remove widgets. Each widget will be a modular component pulling data from specific APIs. Administrators can define default layouts per role and manage available widgets. The system ensures data segregation; users only see information they are authorized to access. The framework must be performant, loading dashboards quickly with lazy loading for heavy data widgets. Responsive design ensures usability on all devices. This personalized approach enhances productivity and user satisfaction by presenting the most relevant information upfront.
