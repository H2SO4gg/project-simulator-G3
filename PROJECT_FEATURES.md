## T-14:System Management & Support 
The System Management & Support feature ensures the platform operates reliably and efficiently at all times. Technical teams can monitor system health, performance metrics, and error logs to quickly detect and resolve issues. Administrators manage user roles, permissions, and global system settings. Automated backups and audit logs protect data and support recovery in case of failures. A dedicated internal support ticket system allows staff and partners to report technical issues and track resolutions. This feature helps maintain system stability, security, and long-term operational continuity.
**Status: Implemented**

## feature/T-21:Travel Agency Update Automation Gateway
This board develops the automated system that ensures integrated travel agencies receive verified, real-time flight updates for their clients' bookings. The system will monitor booking status changes, schedule modifications, and check-in events, then format and transmit these updates to agency systems via secure APIs or webhooks. Updates will be batched or real-time based on agency preference and include full itinerary details, passenger status, and any actionable items (e.g., Check-in now open). A verification layer will confirm the accuracy of information before transmission. Agencies will have a dedicated portal to view update logs, configure notification preferences, and manually refresh booking data. The system will handle retries for failed deliveries and provide delivery status reports. Integration with agency back-office systems ensures updates are reflected in their internal tools and customer communications. This automation reduces manual phone calls and emails, improving accuracy and efficiency for both airlines and agencies. The system must be highly reliable, as agencies depend on this data for customer service.

## feature/T-28: User Role & Permission Management System 
This board develops the centralized system for administrators to define and manage user roles, permissions, and access controls across the platform. The system will provide a hierarchical role model where permissions can be assigned to roles (e.g., Check-in Agent, Flight Manager, Agency Admin) and roles assigned to users. A visual permission matrix will allow admins to toggle specific abilities: view passenger manifests, issue refunds, modify bookings, access financial reports, etc. The system supports permission inheritance and role grouping for efficiency. Integration with the authentication system ensures permissions are evaluated at login and during each user action. An audit trail logs all permission changes for security compliance. The interface will include user role assignment, bulk updates, and permission testing tools. The system must be flexible to accommodate new features and roles as the platform evolves. Robust validation will prevent conflicting permissions and ensure least-privilege principles. This system is fundamental to maintaining security, operational control, and regulatory compliance across a multi-role environment.
